// personally, I expected this to print 3, which it does
// but I think that's because I thought through how the interpreter would see it
// I tested this in Node, which considers this an access before initialization error
// which is really interesting to me.  it implies Node has a two-step variable definition process:
// declaration, which must be called while interpreting the l-value
// then assignment, which is called while interpreting the initializer expression
